# Longest increasing subsequence
The longest growing subsequence problem in computer science aims to discover a subsequence of a given sequence in which the components are ordered from lowest to highest and the subsequence is as long as feasible. This subsequence isn't always continuous or distinct.
Longest growing subsequences are investigated in the context of several mathematical fields, such as algorithmics, random matrix theory, representation theory, and physics. The longest growing subsequence issue can be solved in O(n log n) time, where n is the length of the input sequence.

#### Example
In the first 16 terms of the binary Van der Corput sequence

> 0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9, 5, 13, 3, 11, 7, 15

a longest increasing subsequence is

> 0, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15.

This subsequence has length six; the input sequence has no seven-member increasing subsequences. The longest increasing subsequence in this example is not the only solution: for instance,

> 0, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15

> 0, 2, 6, 9, 13, 15

> 0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 15

are other increasing subsequences of equal length in the same input sequence.
