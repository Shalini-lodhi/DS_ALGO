**Data Structure** is the collection of data components that provides an effective method of storing and organising data in a computer so that it could be used efficiently. Different data structure are as follows:
- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Hashing
- Graph

**Algorithm** is a step-by-step method that outlines a series of instructions that must be followed in a certain order to get the intended result. Algorithms are typically developed independently of underlying languages, which means that an algorithm may be implemented in more than one programming language.
Different Algorithms used to work with data are:
- Searching and Sorting
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- Pattern Searching
- Other String Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Divide and Conquer
- Geometric Algorithms
- Mathematical Algorithms
- Bit Algorithms
- Graph Algorithms
- Randomized Algorithms
- Branch and Bound
