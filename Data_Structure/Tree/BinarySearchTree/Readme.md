# Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a root-bined binary tree that contains two distinct sub-tribes, often marked left and right, each internal node stored a key (and optionally, an associated value). The tree also fulfils the binary search feature, the key in each node being larger or equal to a key in the left sub-tree and less than or equal to any key in the right sub-tree. No key and no structure to differentiate between the leaves (final nodes) of the tree.

Binary search trees are a basic data structure that is used to build more abstract data structures like sets, multisets and associated arrays.
- The key of each visited node should be likened to the key of the element to be inserted or discovered when adding or searching for an element within a binary search tree.
- The form of the binary search tree is totally dependent on the search order and might degenerate.
- The anticipated height of the tree approaches the square root of the number of keys, which increases considerably faster than log n after a lengthy mixed series of random insertion and deletion.
- A lot of study has been done to avoid tree degradation which causes O in the worst cases (n).
